	- Ushahidi translations are now managed through Transifex  - Ushahidi
	  translations are now managed through Transifex 
	- The Ushahidi-Localizations repo is now included in core through a
	  submodule. Rungit submodule update --init when you next pull from git or

	- kinetic dragging: http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/kinetic.html
	- animated panning:http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/animated_panning.html
	- zoom transitions: http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/transition.html / http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/google-v3.html

* More events in main view
	- ushahidi_action.main_sidebar_pre_filters

	  content regardless of what case the csv content is in.
	- Added support for upload/download of Incident reporters
	- Compatibility issues with CSV files generated by non UNIX systems

		In their place are templates (.template.php files) which are used by the installer to generate the respective config files.
* Roles and Permission:
	- User permissions have been refactored into a separate table form roles. This now allows plugins to add their own permissions.
