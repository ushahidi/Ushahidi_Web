                	<h4>Can I have multiple accounts?</h4>
                	Yes. Keep in mind that you can have multiple deployments with one account, though!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                	<a name="2"></a>
                	<h4>Is there a storage limit?</h4>
                	While we aren't enforcing a strict limit on storage at this time, we are monitoring deployments and maintain the right to take action to prevent any one single deployment from hogging resources.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                	<a name="3"></a>
                	<h4>How does Crowdmap work with SMS reports?</h4>
                	Your deployment will not automatically support SMS immediately after you create your deployment. To get this to work, you must create an account at <a href="www.clickatell.com">Clickatell</a> or set up <a href="FrontlineSMS">FrontlineSMS</a> to work with your deployment. To get it to work with your deployment, you will need to follow the instructions in the admin panel of your deployment. These instructions can be found here: http://[YOURDEPLOYMENT].crowdmap.com/admin/settings/sms<br/><br/>If you are looking for non-technical information regarding the approval and verification of SMS messages, check out, <a href="http://ushahidi.com/media/c_Ushahidi-Verification-Guide.pdf">"A Guide To Verification"</a> on the <a href="http://ushahidi.com/community_resources">Ushahidi Community Resources</a> page.

                	<h4>Can I use my own domain name?</h4>
                	Currently we are not offering services to bind your domain name to your Crowdmap deployment. We are looking into offering this in the future so keep your eyes open.

                	<h4>Will this work with Ushahidi plugins?</h4>
                	As of right now, Crowdmap does not offer support for plugins. However, this is something we are very excited about and will be providing approved plugins for your use in the future!
