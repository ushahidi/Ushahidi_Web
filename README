WELCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks for using Ushahidi. We hope that you find the setup and installation process as smooth as possible. We have an active community so if you get stuck along the way, head over to the forums (http://forums.ushahidi.com/) and get some help. In addition to the forums, we have a wiki (http://wiki.ushahidi.com/doku.php) with more detailed information about the platform.


System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A server with Unicode support.
- MySQL version 5.0 or greater.
- PHP version 5.2.3 or greater.
- An HTTP Server. Kohana which Ushahidi is built upon is known to work with the following web servers: Apache 1.3+, Apache2.0+, lighttpd, and MS IIS.


Required Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The follwing is a list of PHP extensions that must be installed on your server in order for Ushahidi to run properly.
- PCRE (http://php.net/pcre) must be compiled with -enable-utf8 and -enable-unicode-properties for UTF-8 functions to work properly.
- iconv (http://php.net/iconv) is required for UTF-8 transliteration.
- mcrypt (http://php.net/mcrypt) is required for encryption.
- SPL (http://php.net/spl) is required for several core libraries
- mbstring (http://php.net/mbstring) which speeds up Kohana's UTF-8 functions.
- cURL (http://php.net/curl) which is used to access remote sites.
- filter (http://php.net/filter) filters data by either validating or sanitizing it.
- JSON (php.net/json)implements the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data-interchange format.
- ctype (php.net/ctype) the functions provided by this extension check whether a character or string falls into a certain character class according to the current locale.
- hash (php.net/hash) Message Digest (hash) engine.

* Need to figure out what extensions you already have installed on your server? Here are instructions to do just that: http://jontangerine.com/silo/php/phpinfo/


Preliminary Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing Ushahidi you will need to give your server authority to write to certian files and folders. Please make sure the following files and folders are writable by your server:
- application/config/config.php
- application/config
- application/cache
- application/logs
- media/uploads
- .htaccess

* The process of configuring file permissions is different for various operating systems. Here are some helpful links about permissions for the Windows (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419) and Unix (http://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/permissions.html) operating systems.
